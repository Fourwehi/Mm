description: Exclude backup folder tmp v0/tmp-v0 from builds and feature work
alwaysApply: true

# Ignore backup source folder (`tmp v0/`, `tmp-v0/`)

`tmp v0/` (and `tmp-v0/` if present) is **backup-only source** and is **not part of the product**.

- Do **not** reference, import, or edit code under `tmp v0/` as part of feature development.
- When diagnosing build/lint/typecheck issues, **exclude `tmp v0/`** from the scope first.
- Keep build tooling configured so `tmp v0/` is ignored:
  - TypeScript: excluded via `tsconfig.json`
  - ESLint: ignored via `eslint.config.mjs`
